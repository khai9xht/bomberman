# Bomberman (JavaFx implementation of an oldschool game Bomberman)
Very simple implementation. So far it contains only a basic game cycle. As for game objects, there are walls, enemies walking randomly around a map, a playable character and a not fully functional bomb.:) All game objects are created from simple geometric objects (rectangles and circles) without any graphical textures.

My plan is to create a simple working demo, then improve graphic of the game and maybe in some far away future add a multiplayer support.
